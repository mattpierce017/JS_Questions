This project showcases understanding of Event Listeners and querySelector Functions. 

Each time you hover over a button, the button will rotate.
When you click on the button, a drop-down response appears.
If you click on another button, that drop-down appears and the previous drop-down will disappear based on toggling the "show-test" element of our main Function.

This creates a crisp and clean experience for the user.
